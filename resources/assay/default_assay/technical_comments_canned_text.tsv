TC001	Coverage_Dropout	Low or variable coverage	Medium	This variant is located in a region with documented coverage dropout (<20X depth in >30% of samples). The variant call may be less reliable due to insufficient read support. Manual review of BAM files and consideration of orthogonal validation is recommended.	Consider Sanger sequencing or alternative capture methods
TC002	High_GC_Region	High GC content	Medium	This variant is located in a high GC content region (>75% GC in 100bp window). High GC regions can exhibit amplification bias and uneven coverage, potentially affecting variant calling accuracy. The observed allele frequency may not accurately reflect the true variant fraction.	Optimize PCR conditions or use GC-specific protocols
TC003	Tandem_Repeat	Repetitive sequences	High	This variant occurs within a tandem repeat region. Repetitive sequences can cause mapping ambiguities and alignment artifacts, leading to false positive or false negative variant calls. Indel calling is particularly challenging in these regions.	Use repeat-aware variant callers and local realignment
TC004	Systematic_Artifact	Systematic artifacts	High	This variant position shows recurrent technical artifacts across multiple samples (>5% occurrence in negative controls). The variant call may represent a systematic sequencing or library preparation artifact rather than a true biological variant.	Apply panel of normals filtering and artifact blacklisting
TC005	Mapping_Ambiguity	Mapping ambiguities	High	This variant is located in a region with significant mapping ambiguity due to pseudogenes or segmental duplications. Reads may be incorrectly mapped from paralogous regions, leading to spurious variant calls.	Use uniquely mapped reads only and check for paralogous variants
TC006	Strand_Bias	Strand bias artifact	Medium	This variant shows significant strand bias (>90% of variant reads from one strand). Strand bias can indicate PCR or sequencing artifacts, oxidative damage (G>T), or FFPE deamination artifacts (C>T).	Apply strand bias filters and consider artifact-specific patterns
TC007	Low_Complexity	Low complexity region	Medium	This variant is located in a low complexity region characterized by homopolymer runs or simple sequence repeats. These regions are prone to polymerase slippage and systematic indel errors.	Increase coverage requirements and use flow-corrected basecalling
TC008	Edge_Effect	Amplicon/capture edge	Low	This variant is located within 10bp of a capture probe or amplicon boundary. Edge effects can cause coverage dropoff and increased error rates near probe boundaries.	Extend probe design or use overlapping amplicons
TC009	Homopolymer_Run	Homopolymer tract	High	This variant is adjacent to or within a homopolymer run (â‰¥6 identical bases). Homopolymer regions have elevated indel error rates due to polymerase slippage during sequencing.	Apply homopolymer-specific quality thresholds
TC010	FFPE_Artifact	FFPE-specific artifact	Medium	This C>T or G>A variant may represent an FFPE deamination artifact. Formalin fixation can cause cytosine deamination resulting in artifactual C>T transitions, particularly at low allele fractions.	Use UDG treatment or FFPE-specific variant filters
TC011	Problematic_Region_NOS	Problematic Region NOS	Unknown	This variant is located in a region flagged as problematic for technical reasons not otherwise specified. Additional validation may be required to confirm the variant call.	Review historical QC data and consider orthogonal validation

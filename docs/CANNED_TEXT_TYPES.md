1	General Gene Info – boilerplate overview of the gene
2	Gene Dx Interpretation – gene-level meaning for the patient’s specific diagnosis
3	General Variant Info – technical description of the variant itself
4	Variant Dx Interpretation – variant-specific clinical meaning for the diagnosis
5	Incidental / Secondary Findings – ACMG-SF-style reportables unrelated to the primary dx
6	Chromosomal Alteration Interpretation – CNVs / fusions / large SVs
7	Pertinent Negatives – explicit “no clinically significant variants found in …” statements
8	Biomarkers – TMB, MSI, expression; we just bucket values vs. thresholds

# Evidence Scoring Refactoring: Strategy Pattern Implementation

**Date**: 2025-06-17  
**Refactoring Type**: Architectural improvement using Strategy Pattern  
**Files Modified**: `src/annotation_engine/tiering.py`, `src/annotation_engine/scoring_strategies.py` (new)  
**Tests Added**: `tests/test_scoring_strategies.py` (new)

## Problem Statement

The original evidence scoring implementation in `tiering.py` had several architectural issues:

### Issues with Original Implementation
1. **Tight Coupling**: Evidence scoring logic was embedded directly in the `TieringEngine._calculate_evidence_score` method
2. **Hard to Test**: Individual scoring strategies could not be tested in isolation
3. **Inflexible**: Adding new scoring approaches required modifying the core tiering logic
4. **Complex Conditionals**: The scoring method had long chains of if-else statements for evidence type detection
5. **Maintainability**: Changes to scoring logic required understanding the entire tiering engine

### Original Code Problems
```python
# Old implementation - tightly coupled, hard to test
def _calculate_evidence_score(self, evidence_list: List[Evidence], context: ActionabilityType) -> float:
    # 50+ lines of if-else chains for evidence type detection
    if "FDA" in evidence.description or evidence.source_kb == "FDA":
        weight = weights.fda_approved
    elif "guideline" in evidence.description.lower():
        weight = weights.professional_guidelines
    elif "meta-analysis" in evidence.description.lower():
        weight = weights.meta_analysis
    # ... many more conditionals
```

## Solution: Strategy Pattern Implementation

The Strategy Pattern allows algorithms (scoring strategies) to be selected at runtime while keeping them independent and interchangeable.

### New Architecture

#### 1. Abstract Base Class
```python
class EvidenceScorer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def can_score(self, evidence: Evidence) -> bool:
        """Determine if this scorer can handle the given evidence"""
        
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_score(self, evidence: Evidence, context: ActionabilityType) -> float:
        """Calculate the weighted score for this evidence"""
        
    @abstractmethod
    def get_evidence_strength(self, evidence: Evidence) -> EvidenceStrength:
        """Determine the strength level of this evidence"""
```

#### 2. Concrete Strategy Classes
- **`FDAApprovedScorer`**: Handles FDA-approved biomarker evidence (highest weight)
- **`GuidelineEvidenceScorer`**: Handles professional guideline evidence
- **`ClinicalStudyScorer`**: Handles clinical studies (RCTs, meta-analyses, etc.)
- **`ExpertConsensusScorer`**: Handles expert consensus evidence
- **`CaseReportScorer`**: Handles case reports and small studies
- **`PreclinicalScorer`**: Handles preclinical and computational evidence

#### 3. Strategy Manager
```python
class EvidenceScoringManager:
    def __init__(self, weights: EvidenceWeights):
        self.scorers = [
            FDAApprovedScorer(weights),
            GuidelineEvidenceScorer(weights),
            ClinicalStudyScorer(weights),
            # ... all scorers
        ]
    
    def calculate_evidence_score(self, evidence_list: List[Evidence], context: ActionabilityType) -> float:
        """Coordinate scoring across all strategies"""
```

#### 4. Refactored Tiering Engine
```python
# New implementation - clean, delegated, testable
def _calculate_evidence_score(self, evidence_list: List[Evidence], context: ActionabilityType) -> float:
    """Calculate quantitative evidence score using strategy pattern"""
    return self.scoring_manager.calculate_evidence_score(evidence_list, context)
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Each scorer focuses on one specific evidence type
- TieringEngine focuses on tier assignment logic, not scoring details
- Clear boundaries between scoring and tier assignment

### 2. Testability
- Individual scorers can be unit tested in isolation
- Mock evidence objects can test specific scoring scenarios
- 16 comprehensive unit tests added covering all scorers

### 3. Extensibility
- New scoring strategies can be added without modifying existing code
- Each scorer can have its own complex logic without affecting others
- Easy to experiment with different scoring approaches

### 4. Maintainability
- Scoring logic is organized into logical, focused classes
- Changes to one evidence type don't affect others
- Clear naming and documentation for each strategy

### 5. Configurability
- Each scorer receives the same `EvidenceWeights` configuration
- Scoring behavior can be tuned through configuration
- Consistent weight application across all evidence types

## Code Examples

### Before: Tightly Coupled Scoring
```python
# 50+ lines of complex conditionals
if "FDA" in evidence.description or evidence.source_kb == "FDA":
    weight = weights.fda_approved
elif "guideline" in evidence.description.lower():
    weight = weights.professional_guidelines
# ... many more conditions
```

### After: Strategy-Based Scoring
```python
class FDAApprovedScorer(EvidenceScorer):
    def can_score(self, evidence: Evidence) -> bool:
        return ("FDA" in evidence.description or 
                evidence.source_kb == "FDA")
    
    def calculate_score(self, evidence: Evidence, context: ActionabilityType) -> float:
        base_score = self.weights.fda_approved
        # Context-specific logic for FDA evidence
        return base_score * context_modifier * confidence
```

## Testing Improvements

### Unit Test Coverage
- **16 comprehensive tests** covering all scoring strategies
- **Isolated testing** of each scorer's behavior
- **Context-specific testing** (therapeutic, diagnostic, prognostic)
- **Edge case handling** (empty evidence, unmatched evidence)

### Test Examples
```python
def test_fda_evidence_prioritization(self):
    """Test that FDA evidence gets highest scores"""
    scorer = FDAApprovedScorer(weights)
    fda_evidence = Evidence(description="FDA-approved biomarker...")
    
    score = scorer.calculate_score(fda_evidence, ActionabilityType.THERAPEUTIC)
    assert score > 0.8  # FDA evidence should score high

def test_context_specific_scoring(self):
    """Test that evidence scores appropriately by context"""
    therapeutic_score = scorer.calculate_score(evidence, ActionabilityType.THERAPEUTIC)
    diagnostic_score = scorer.calculate_score(evidence, ActionabilityType.DIAGNOSTIC)
    
    # Context-appropriate scoring
    assert therapeutic_score > diagnostic_score
```

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Performance Overhead
- Strategy selection is O(1) for each evidence item
- No significant performance degradation vs. original implementation
- Memory usage remains comparable

### Improved Maintainability Performance
- Reduced debugging time due to isolated components
- Faster development of new scoring approaches
- Easier troubleshooting of scoring issues

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- **Full backward compatibility** maintained
- External API unchanged
- Same `_calculate_evidence_score` method signature
- Same output format and scoring behavior

### Configuration Impact
- No changes required to existing `EvidenceWeights` configuration
- All existing weight settings continue to work
- New scorers respect existing weight hierarchy

## Future Extensibility

### Easy Addition of New Scorers
```python
class PharmacoGenomicsScorer(EvidenceScorer):
    """New scorer for pharmacogenomics evidence"""
    def can_score(self, evidence: Evidence) -> bool:
        return "pharmacogenomics" in evidence.description.lower()
    
    def calculate_score(self, evidence: Evidence, context: ActionabilityType) -> float:
        # Specialized scoring logic for pharmacogenomics
        pass
```

### Configurable Scorer Selection
Future enhancement could allow dynamic scorer configuration:
```python
# Future possibility
scoring_manager = EvidenceScoringManager(
    weights=weights,
    enabled_scorers=["FDA", "Guidelines", "ClinicalStudy"]  # Configurable
)
```

## Validation

### Test Results
- **16/16 unit tests passing**
- **All existing functionality preserved**
- **Smoke tests confirm no regression**

### Coordination with Concurrent Development
- **Dependency Injection Integration**: Another agent concurrently added DI container and Protocol interfaces
- **Seamless Integration**: Both refactoring efforts complement each other perfectly
- **Combined Benefits**: Strategy Pattern + DI = highly testable, maintainable, mockable architecture
- **No Conflicts**: Both changes maintain full backward compatibility

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Reduced complexity**: Each scorer ~50 lines vs. original ~100+ line method
- **Improved cohesion**: Each class has single responsibility
- **Better abstraction**: Clear interfaces and contracts

## Conclusion

The Strategy Pattern refactoring successfully addresses the architectural issues in the evidence scoring system while maintaining full backward compatibility. The new system is more testable, maintainable, and extensible, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements to the annotation engine's scoring capabilities.

# Implementation Summary: Tools & Templates

## Overview

This document outlines our strategic approach to building the Annotation Engine by leveraging proven patterns from leading clinical genomics tools while avoiding their environmental complexity.

## Implementation Strategy

### **Tools We'll Use Directly**
1. **VEP** - Direct usage with specific plugin configuration
2. **vcfanno** - Direct usage for annotation layering  
3. **Nextflow** - Direct usage for pipeline orchestration
4. **Docker/Singularity** - Direct usage for containerization

### **Tools We'll Emulate/Adapt (Re-implement in Our Environment)**
1. **PCGR/PCGRR** - Emulate annotation workflow and report structure (re-implement, don't use their environment)
2. **Scout/PecanPie** - Emulate UI patterns for clinical variant review
3. **InterVar/CancerVar** - Emulate rule logic in our custom engine
4. **Nirvana** - Emulate testing strategy and validation approach
5. **Hartwig tools** - Emulate pipeline patterns via nf-core/oncoanalyser fork

### **Knowledge Base Strategy (No External APIs)**
- **OncoKB Data** - Use downloaded/cached OncoKB data from our KB bundles (not live API)
- **All KBs Local** - ClinVar, CIViC, COSMIC, gnomAD, etc. all from local data bundles
- **Version-Locked** - All KB data versioned and bundled for reproducibility

### **MVP Scope Adjustments**
- **Real-time Collaboration** - Placeholder implementation, not MVP priority
- **ML Framework** - Architecture defined, implementation TBD post-MVP

### **6. Knowledge Base Integration**
**Local Data Bundle Approach** (No External APIs)
- **Use Case:** Fast, reproducible KB lookups without API dependencies
- **Implementation:** Pre-downloaded, indexed KB data in versioned bundles
- **Specific Tasks:**
  - OncoKB data extraction and local indexing
  - ClinVar, CIViC, COSMIC local processing
  - Version-locked bundle management
  - Fast lookup optimization

### **7. Data Bundle Management**
**Primary Template:** PCGR's quarterly bundles
- **Use Case:** Versioned, reproducible KB snapshots
- **Implementation:** Automated bundle builder with validation
- **Specific Tasks:**
  - Download all KBs with version tracking
  - Create indexed lookups for performance
  - Bundle validation and distribution system

### **8. Quality Control & Testing**
**Primary Template:** Nirvana testing approach
- **Use Case:** Continuous integration with clinical validation
- **Implementation:** Daily concordance testing against known variants
- **Specific Tasks:**
  - >95% concordance requirements with established tools
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Clinical test case validation with known variants

### **9. Deployment Infrastructure**
**Hybrid Approach:** nf-core + Enterprise patterns
- **nf-core:** Container build patterns, CI/CD workflows
- **Enterprise:** Kubernetes deployment, HIPAA compliance
- **Implementation:** Clean Docker → Singularity → K8s progression
- **Specific Tasks:**
  - Multi-stage Docker builds for performance
  - Nextflow profiles (local/cluster/cloud)
  - Clinical security and compliance requirements

### **10. Configuration Management**
**Hybrid Approach:** CGI (YAML) + OncoKB (versioning) patterns
- **CGI:** YAML-first configuration structure
- **OncoKB:** Version tracking and validation patterns
- **Implementation:** Modular YAML configs with metadata
- **Specific Tasks:**
  - Clinical thresholds management
  - Rule definitions and weights
  - Environment-specific settings

## Novel Components (Beyond Existing Tools)

### **1. Unified Rule Engine**
- Combines ACMG/AMP, CGC/VICC, and OncoKB approaches
- YAML-driven for transparency and updates
- Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance

### **2. Integrated Clinical Database**
- More comprehensive than existing tools
- Complete variant-diagnosis-interpretation tracking
- ML training data preparation

### **3. ML Confidence Framework** (Post-MVP)
- Architecture defined in database schema
- Training pipeline planned
- Transparent feature importance

### **4. Real-Time Collaboration** (Placeholder for Post-MVP)
- WebSocket-based live updates
- Concurrent editing with conflict resolution
- User presence indicators

## Environment Philosophy

**Clean Implementation Strategy:**
- **Avoid Complex Environments:** Don't use PCGR's actual environment (known to be messy)
- **Re-implement Patterns:** Take their proven approaches but build clean
- **Modern Standards:** Use current best practices (Poetry, FastAPI, React)
- **Containerized Everything:** Immutable, reproducible environments
- **Clinical Grade:** HIPAA-compliant, auditable, scalable

## Success Metrics

1. **Concordance:** >95% agreement with established tools (PCGR, InterVar)
2. **Performance:** <10 seconds per variant for complete annotation
3. **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime for clinical environments
4. **Usability:** Clinical workflows completable in <5 minutes per case
5. **Compliance:** Full audit trails for regulatory requirements

This approach ensures we build on proven foundations while creating a modern, maintainable, and clinically-compliant annotation platform.
